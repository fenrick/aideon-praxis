# Aideon Suite

This repository contains **Aideon Suite**, a local-first, graph-native digital twin platform that
treats **time as a first-class dimension**. The suite is built as a set of modules that share the
same time-first meta-model, adapter patterns, and security posture.

Within the suite:

- **Aideon Praxis** is the core desktop digital twin module (React/Tauri canvas + Rust engines).
- **Aideon Chrona** provides time-based visualisation.
- **Aideon Metis** focuses on analytics and reasoning.
- **Aideon Continuum** handles orchestration and automation.
- **Aideon Mneme** owns persistence and shared DTOs.

See `docs/DESIGN.md` for suite-level product and conceptual design, and `Architecture-Boundary.md`
for code-level layering and boundaries.

## Getting started

For a full walkthrough (prerequisites, setup, dev workflow, and issues helpers), see
`docs/getting-started.md`. The commands below are the most common entry points.

### Common commands (quick reference)

- Install deps: `corepack enable && pnpm install`
- Dev (Praxis workspace + Tauri host): see `docs/getting-started.md` for the recommended terminal layout.
- Lint/typecheck/test (TS): `pnpm run node:lint && pnpm run node:typecheck && pnpm run node:test`
- Rust checks: `pnpm run host:lint && pnpm run host:check`

See `docs/getting-started.md` and `docs/commands.md` for the full list of pnpm commands used across
JS/TS and the Rust workspace.
