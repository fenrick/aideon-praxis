# Interaction Patterns

**Scope:** Praxis Desktop template screen. Defines canonical shortcuts and interaction behaviours.

## Keyboard shortcuts (desktop)

- `⇧+Space` – focus time cursor (branch select).
- `← / →` – scrub commits (previous/next) when timeline is focused.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` – undo last selection/edit/time change.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` – redo.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D` – toggle debug overlay (dev only).

## Panels and resizing

- Sidebar / content / inspector use `ResizablePanelGroup` with persisted widths under `praxis-shell-panels` (local storage).
- Collapse respects min widths (sidebar ≥14%, inspector ≥16%).

## Undo/redo model

- Command stack records selection changes, inspector edits, and time-cursor moves.
- Each command stores `redo` and `undo` functions; replay triggers the same adapter calls to keep UI and data in sync.

## Navigation + focus

- Selection clears when changing Scenario, Template, or Commit.
- Inspector opens whenever selection is non-empty; properties are tab-focusable.
- Time slider commits on `onValueCommit` only; arrow keys move one commit at a time.

## Undo/redo-safe operations

- Selection changes (widget/node/edge).
- Property edits that result in `applyOperations` requests.
- Time cursor branch/commit changes that refresh snapshots.
