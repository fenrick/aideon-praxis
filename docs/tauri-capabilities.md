# Tauri Capabilities

Parent: #95

This document outlines the capability model for the Tauri-based desktop host. Capabilities are
enforced in dev and packaged builds via Tauri’s permissions manifest and per-window capability files.

## Goals

- Preserve strict boundaries: Renderer ↔ Host via preload IPC; Host ↔ Worker via UDS/RPC.
- No network ports in desktop mode; deny-by-default for file system and process access.
- Keep a single config path so desktop/server builds do not fork.

## Capability Files (to be added)

- `fs-read-app-data` — read-only access to app cache/config dirs.
- `uds-ipc` — open UNIX domain sockets for worker RPC only.
- `clipboard` — optional, disabled by default.

These will be referenced from `packages/host/tauri.conf.json` once implemented.

## Security Defaults

- `allowlist`: minimal; commands must be explicitly exposed.
- `CSP`: strict; no remote HTTP in renderer.
- `deno/telemetry`: disabled; no external calls without allowlist.

## Next Steps

- Define capability TOML files under `packages/host/capabilities/`.
- Add a build-time check ensuring capabilities are referenced in `tauri.conf.json`.
- Unit tests for deny-by-default behavior in preload IPC bridge.
